				<h2 id="history">History</h2>
				<p>The American Pit Bull Terrier (APBT) is medium-sized, and has a short coat and smooth well-defined 
				muscle structure. Its eyes are round to almond shaped, and its ears are small to medium in length 
				and can be natural or cropped. The tail is slightly thick and tapers to a point. The coat is glossy, 
				smooth, short, and stiff to the touch. The coat color can vary widely. The pit bull is not a distinct 
				breed which may make it difficult for experts to identify, and while mixed breed dogs are often labelled 
				a "pit bull" if they have certain physical characteristics such as a square shaped head or bulky body type, 
				visual identification of mixed breed dogs is not recommended by the scholarly community.</p>
	 			<p>The dog was bred first to bait bulls and bears. When bear-baiting and bull-baiting were deemed inhumane, 
	 			rat-baiting and dog fighting became more popular. The APBT Breed was used in both sports, and its 
	 			prevalence in being put in pits with rats, or other dogs led to "pit" being added to its name. In America, 
	 			farmers and ranchers used their APBTs for protection, as catch dogs for semi-wild cattle and hogs, to hunt, 
	 			and to drive livestock. The dog was used during World War I and World War II as a way of delivering messages 
	 			on the battlefield.</p> 
	 			<p>All pit bulls were created with similar cross-breeding between bulldogs and terriers, but each individual pit 
	 			bull breed has a distinct history. The term Pit Bull is a generic term used to describe dogs with similar 
	 			physical characteristics. Usually a "pit bull" is considered one of several breeds including the 
	 			Staffordshire Bull Terrier, American Pit Bull Terrier, American Staffordshire Terrier, Bull Terrier, or 
	 			any mix thereof. In some parts of the world, the American Bulldog and Dogo Argentino are also classified 
	 			as a "Pit Bull-type" dog, despite major genetic differences. Any dog that is mixed with a "bully breed" 
	 			may also be called a "pit bull" including those that are descended from the English Bulldog, French Bulldog, 
	 			Boston Terrier and Cane Corso.</p>

					<h3>Pit Bull Terrier</h3>
					<p>The Pit Bull Terrier was created by breeding Old English Terriers and Old English Bulldogs
					together to produce a dog that combined the gameness of the terrier with the strength and
					athleticism of the bulldog. These dogs were bred in England, and arrived in the United States where
					they became the direct ancestors of the American Pitbull Terrier. Pit Bull Terriers have successfully 
					fill the role of companion dogs, police dogs, and therapy dogs.</p>
					<h3>Staffordshire Bull Terrier</h3>
					<p>The Staffordshire Bull Terrier had its beginnings in the early 19th century by breeding bulldogs, 
					mastiffs, and terriers together. The resulting offspring were originally known as the "Bull and 
					Terrier Dog", the "Pit Dog", and the "Pit Bull Terrier". The early bull terriers of the Elizabethan 
					era were often used for bull baiting and with a weight of between 100 lbs (45 kg) and 120 lbs (54 kg) 
					were significantly larger than the modern bull terrier. These dogs imported to America from England 
					as early as 1870, where they were known as the Pit Dog, Pit Bull Terrier, and later American Bull 
					Terrier or Yankee Terrier. They were imported primarily, but not exclusively, for pit fighting.</p>

	 			<h2 id="notable">Notable Pit Bulls</h2>
				<p>Pit Bull breeds have become famous for their roles as soldiers, police dogs, search and 
				rescue dogs, actors, television personalities, seeing eye dogs, and celebrity pets. Historically, 
				the Bull Terrier mix Nipper and the American Staffordshire Terrier, Pete the Pup from the Little 
				Rascals are the most well known.</p>
				<p>Lesser known, but still historically notable pit bulls include Billie Holiday's companion 
				"Mister", Helen Keller's dog "Sir Thomas", Buster Brown's dog "Tige", Horatio Jackson's dog 
				"Bud", President Theodore Roosevelt's Pit Bull Terrier "Pete", "Jack Brutus" who served for the
				102nd Infantry, 26th (Yankee) Division during World War I, and Sir Walter Scott's "Wasp".</p>

					<ol>
						<li>Weela - who helped save 32 people, 29 dogs, 3 horses, and 1 cat.</li>
						<li>Popsicle - a five-month-old puppy originally found nearly dead in a freezer, who grew to

					<p>A Pit Bull's genetic make up was developed so it would be a good fighting dog. However, this
					genetic disposition does not mean that all Pit Bulls are aggressive or that they are prone to
					attacking other animals. Pit Bulls require the same amount of socialization training as other
					dogs during puppy-hood, possibly more. Like any dog, a Pit Bull that is well socialized is less
					likely to attack when it feels threatened. The Pit Bull breed is known to be more "rough and
					tumble" during play time, but frequent socialization with other dogs can mean that a Pit Bull 
					pet goes into adulthood with a positive feeling towards other dogs.</p>
					<p>The essential characteristics of the American Pit Bull Terrier are strength, confidence, and zest 
					for life. This breed is eager to please and brimming over with enthusiasm. APBTs makes excellent 
					family companions and have always been noted for their love of children. This breed does very well
					in performance events because of its high level of intelligence and its willingness to work. American 
					Pit Bull Terriers excel in many dog sports, including weight pulling, dog agility, flyball, lure coursing,
					and advanced obedience competition.</p>
