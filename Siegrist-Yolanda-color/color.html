		<h2 id="history">History</h2>
		<p>All pit bulls were created with similar cross-breeding between bulldogs and 
			terriers, but each individual pit bull breed has a distinct history. The term Pit Bull is a 
			generic term used to describe dogs with similar physical characteristics. Usually a "pit bull" 
			is considered one of several breeds including the Staffordshire Bull Terrier, American Pit Bull 
			Terrier, American Staffordshire Terrier, Bull Terrier, or any mix thereof. In some parts of the 
			world, the American Bulldog and Dogo Argentino are also classified as a "Pit Bull-type" dog, 
			despite major genetic differences. Any dog that is mixed with a "bully breed" may also be called 
			a "pit bull" including those that are descended from the English Bulldog, French Bulldog, Boston 
			Terrier and Cane Corso. The pit bull is not a distinct breed which may make it difficult for experts 
			to identify, and while mixed breed dogs are often labelled a "pit bull" if they have certain 
			physical characteristics such as a square shaped head or bulky body type, visual identification of
			mixed breed dogs is not recommended by the scholarly community.</p>
		<h4>Pit Bull Terrier</h4>
		<p>The Pit Bull Terrier was created by breeding Old English Terriers and Old English Bulldogs
			together to produce a dog that combined the gameness of the terrier with the strength and
			athleticism of the bulldog.</p>
		<h4>Staffordshire Bull Terrier</h4>
		<p>The Staffordshire Bull Terrier had its beginnings in the early 19th century by
			breeding bulldogs, mastiffs, and terriers together. The resulting offspring were 
			originally known as the "Bull and Terrier Dog", the "Pit Dog", and the "Pit Bull Terrier".</p>
		<h2 id="social">Socialization</h2>
		<p>A Pit Bull's genetic make up was developed so it would be a good fighting dog. However, this
			genetic disposition does not mean that all Pit Bulls are aggressive or that they are prone to
			attacking other animals. Pit Bulls require the same amount of socialization training as other
			dogs during puppy-hood, possibly more. Like any dog, a Pit Bull that is well socialized is less
			likely to attack when it feels threatened. The Pit Bull breed is known to be more "rough and
			tumble" during play time, but frequent socialization with other dogs can mean that a Pit Bull 
			pet goes into adulthood with a positive feeling towards other dogs.</p>
		<h2 id="notable">Notable Pit Bulls</h2>
		<p>Pit Bull breeds have become famous for their roles as soldiers, police dogs, search and 
			rescue dogs, actors, television personalities, seeing eye dogs, and celebrity pets. Historically, 
			the Bull Terrier mix Nipper and the American Staffordshire Terrier, Pete the Pup from the Little 
			Rascals are the most well known.</p>
		<p>Lesser known, but still historically notable pit bulls include Billie Holiday's companion 
			"Mister", Helen Keller's dog "Sir Thomas", Buster Brown's dog "Tige", Horatio Jackson's dog 
			"Bud", President Theodore Roosevelt's Pit Bull Terrier "Pete", "Jack Brutus" who served for the
			102nd Infantry, 26th (Yankee) Division during World War I, and Sir Walter Scott's "Wasp".</p>
		<p>Modernly significant pit bulls are: Weela, who helped save 32 people, 29 dogs, 3 horses, and 
			1 cat; Popsicle, a five-month-old puppy originally found nearly dead in a freezer, who grew to 
			become one of the nation's most important police dogs; Norton, who was placed in the Purina 
			Animal Hall of Fame after he rescued his owner from a severe reaction to a spider bite; Titan, 
			who rescued his owner's wife, who would have died from an aneurysm, D-Boy, who took three bullets 
			to save his family from an intruder with a gun, and Lilly, who lost a leg after being struck by a 
			freight train while pulling her unconscious owner from the train tracks.</p>
